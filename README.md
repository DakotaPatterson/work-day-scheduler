# work-day-scheduler

A work day scheduler

## Description

This project is a work day scheduler to help the user keep track of important events happening that day. My motivation was to make a webpage that allowed a user to add appointmnets for the upcoming day to keep organized and on top of the day. This webpage allows the user to save any apointment between 9AM and 5PM of the current day and the events will stay on the page even after refreshing that way that have a convenient place to store this information. I have learned that making sure the Javascript is interactive to the user and displays with visually appealing css makes a webpage unique and easy to traverse while also providing an useful concept to the user.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

The best way to use this is to click on any [time block](assets/timeBlock.png) and then enter the associated event happening at that time.

Once this is complete you can select the save button on the side of that time block to save this event into the local storage.

If you would like to remove this event you just need to delete it from the time block and then resave the block.
